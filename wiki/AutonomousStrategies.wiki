*Option 1 Starting Position from Left of Dispenser (LofD) and Right of Dispenser (RofD)*
_Strategy_: Drivers do not need to differentiate these two starting positions; the program does it automatically.
 _Move forward till close to the line at maximum speed;_
 _Stop, move with slow speed till one of the light sensors reaches the line;_
 _Stop, reset encoder values, then move slowly till both light sensors read the line;_
 Calcuate the angle between robot and line, then use turn robot to close to staight along the line, using the angle as reference;
 Follow the line and move to read IR position; 
 Scan IR, decide which column is the IR beacon on;
 If IR beacon is on the middle, continue moving, then place ring;
 If IR beacon is on the sides, back and turn till reaches the line, then follows the line and place the ring;
